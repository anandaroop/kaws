    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/josef-albers\">Josef Albers</a>’s extensive series, “Homage to the Square,” occupied him for more than 25 years. The artist, an early student (and later, a professor) of the Bauhaus, the legendary German art and design school, was fascinated by the ability to create the illusion of three-dimensions using only color and spatial relationships. Albers had a long career as a professor at Black Mountain College before joining Yale University’s Art Department, where he began his iconic abstract series at age 62. Over the coming decades, Albers would make more than 1,000 oil paint and silkscreen “Homages” before his death at age 88 in 1976. The works feature nested squares in different shades, which Albers often applied directly from the paint tube onto fiberboard. The combination of colors would often create optical and psychological effects, including after-images—the lingering perception of colors in the visual field that aren’t really there.</p>",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/shepard-fairey\">Shepard Fairey</a> designed his first sticker campaign, “André the Giant has a Posse,” while he was still a student at the Rhode Island School of Design. The sticker featured the late professional French wrestler alongside his legendary height and weight—7 feet, four inches and 520 pounds. After Fairey and his skateboarding community plastered André’s face across Providence, Rhode Island, the motif took on a life of its own and began appearing in cities nationwide. Responding to this growing popularity, Fairey produced a stripped-down version of the design, which he titled <i>Obey Giant</i>, that soon became the artist’s logo. <i>Obey Giant</i> has made cameo appearances in movies and shows including <i>Batman Forever</i> (1999), <i>Phone Booth</i> (2002), and <i>Family Guy</i>, and the campaign was the subject of a 1996 documentary by Helen Stickler. Fairey has since modeled a number of his most iconic works after <i>Obey Giant’s</i> simple aesthetic, including Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign poster, “Hope.” </p>",

Warhol saw Coke as a great social equalizer, once stating “What’s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it.”</p>",

Warhol worked with two notable collaborators on these eccentric works—a Pop Art dealer named Ivan Karp suggested the unlikely subject, and Warhol’s printmaker Gerard Malaga provided the photograph upon which the screenprint is based.</p>",

Made using several silkscreens for a bold and textured look, Warhol’s “Dollar Signs” appear as if they were lifted from a sketchpad or scrawled across a receipt. Separated from currency and expanded to cartoonishly large proportions, the series equates art with money. Warhol’s work was often seen as both a barometer and a criticism of American culture—in much the same way that Warhol’s “<a href=\"http://artsy.net/collection/andy-warhol-coca-cola\">Coca-Cola</a>,” “<a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/andy-warhol-brillo-boxes\">Brillo Box</a>,” and “<a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/andy-warhol-campbells-soup-can\">Campbell’s Soup Cans</a>” series criticized American consumerism in the 1960s, “Dollar Sign” reflects the growing American obsession with wealth and status in the 1980s.</p>",

Nonetheless, he is often credited with reinventing stained glass—applying his avant-garde sensibility to a medium with over 1,000 years of history. Featuring cubist forms, Chagall’s stained glass windows are often religious in theme, whether designed for synagogues in Israel or cathedrals in Europe. With their bright blue backgrounds, Chagall’s most celebrated glassworks include the windows at Reims Cathedral in France, the United Nations in New York City, and the Art Institute of Chicago. These large-scale works often took years of preparation and planning, leaving behind a variety of drawings and prints that reveal Chagall’s creative process.</p>",

He returned to the form while living in Paris in the 1920s and ’30s, turning his eyes toward the human body as a surface for sculpture. With his wife Louisa as his muse, Calder created a suite of jewelry out of metal wire and small shards of porcelain, glass, and other found materials. Taking curvilinear forms, his necklaces, earrings, and brooches (which Calder treated as wearable sculptures) were heavy, ornamental, and known to be uncomfortable. Over the course of his career, Calder created more than 1,800 unique pieces of jewelry, and though many pieces were worn by the rich and famous—Peggy Guggenheim, Mary Rockefeller, and Angelica Huston were amongst his devotees—he kept his prices reasonable, charging $25 per brooch. Some of these same pieces are now worth more than $100,000.</p>",

Over time, the “Radiant Baby” gained darker significance through Haring’s depictions of nuclear proliferation, in which the baby appears inside atomic mushroom clouds and scenes of war and violence. While “Radiant Baby” can be interpreted in several ways, the design was Haring’s personal favorite among his iconic creations and is now cherished as the artist’s signature tag.</p>",

The walkways spanned three kilometers and attracted over a million visitors during the short installation.

While the first Mr. DOB had a somewhat fierce appearance with sharp, menacing teeth, the character grew cuter and cuter over time, setting the stage for all of Murakami’s iconic “Superflat” motifs such as his <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/takashi-murakami-flowers\">smiling flowers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/takashi-murakami-jellyfish-eyes\">jellyfish eyes</a>.</p>",

For example, in <i>Incomplete Open Cubes</i> (1974–1982), LeWitt calculated every way the shape could appear “incomplete” yet still three- dimensional, rendering his findings in a series of model cubes that had anywhere from one to nine missing limbs. In his <a href=\"https://www.nga.gov/education/teachers/lessons-activities/new-angles/sol-lewitt.html\">own words</a>, the cube “lacked the expressive force of more interesting forms and shapes,” so it was an ideal candidate for deconstruction and multiplication.</p>",

Warhol’s silkscreen <i>Superman</i> (1981) reached a new auction record in 2017, selling for over $200,000 at Phillips.

Indiana believed that each number has its own personality and symbolism, with one representing birth and zero representing death, and the numbers in between symbolizing periods from childhood through adulthood. He also attached significance to the colors he chose for his numbers, favoring red for one and four to convey the vibrancy of birth and the fiery period of adolescence, and grey for zero to convey a waning sense of time at the close of one’s life. For Indiana, many of these numbers also held personal connections, such as the highway routes and building numbers that were important to him.</p>",

His “big face portraits,” as they were affectionately called at the time, were almost always larger than life in size, reflective of the monumental canvases beloved by his Abstract Expressionist peers. Katz’s early portraits also marked the beginning of the Pop Art movement. Much like Andy Warhol, Katz found inspiration in mass media, borrowing the graphic aesthetic of the advertising world and the cinematic compositions of the film industry. Even his portraits of his wife <a href=\"http://artsy.net/collection/alex-katz-ada\">Ada</a> (of which there are over 200) reflect the Pop Art obsession with celebrity. “When [Ada] was young she went to the movies and was very influenced,” Katz <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/people-events/article/2144031/alex-katz-captures-new-yorkers-daily-life-cool-way\">once explained</a>. “All her gestures come out of movies...I am really lucky!”</p>",

The day before the Congress opened on April 20th, Picasso even named his newborn daughter “Paloma,” the Spanish word for dove. Though Picasso was apolitical for most of his early adulthood, his perspective was fundamentally changed after the 1937 aerial attack on the village of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. Marking a shift, Picasso created his agonizing masterwork of the same year, <i>Guernica</i>, and continued his career wrestling with the tragedy of war and ideals of world peace.</p>",

Modeled after a publicity still for the film <i>Flaming Star</i> (1960), the portrait is also the artist’s only portrayal of a full-length figure. For the fame-obsessed Warhol, Elvis was an especially intriguing subject to explore in the early ’60s, as the musical legend’s career declined, already overshadowed by a new generation of performers. Showing how Elvis had turned into a mass-produced commodity, not unlike <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/andy-warhol-campbells-soup-can\">Campbell’s Soup Cans</a>, Warhol often portrayed repeated images of Elvis on the same canvas. One of these works, <i>Triple Elvis (Ferus Type)</i> (1963), holds the auction record for the series, selling for nearly $82 million at Christie’s in 2014. A similar piece, <i>Double Elvis</i> (1963) now hangs in the Museum of Modern Art, but originally left Warhol’s studio as a gift to Bob Dylan, who could not have anticipated the future market value of this present. “I once traded an Andy Warhol <i>Elvis Presley</i> for a sofa, which was a stupid thing to do,” Dylan later regretted.</p>",

After moving to Paris, Chagall began working with the prominent art dealer Ambroise Vollard, who also cherished the circus (and whose clients included many leading talents of the time such as Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh). In 1927, Vollard asked Chagall to create a suite of gouache paintings about the circus, giving the artist full access to sketch the flying acrobats and gaudy costumes from his personal box at the Cirque d’Hiver in Paris. In 1962, Chagall returned to these early paintings and transformed them into 23 color and 15 black-and-white lithographs, capturing the wild pandemonium of the circus with a painterly printmaking technique.</p>",

    "description": "<p>For over six decades, <a href=\"http://artsy.net/artist/alex-katz\">Alex Katz</a> has found inspiration in all types of flowers, transforming wind-blown tiger lilies, marigolds, roses, and petunias into iconic works of Pop art. In the 1950s, Katz grew frustrated that his <a href=\"http://artsy.net/collection/alex-katz-portraits\">portraits</a> lacked a sense of movement, so he began painting the wildflowers he discovered near his summer home in Maine. “When I did the first figure groups, <i>The Cocktail Party and Lawn Party</i>, I felt they didn’t move enough,” he <a href=\"http://www.alexkatz.com/bibliography/selected_articles_and_reviews/Interview_with_Alex_Katz-Sylvester_David-\">said</a> about this moment of inspiration. “And that’s one of the reasons I did the large flower paintings.” Over time, Katz’s floral renditions became more vibrant and alive, often featuring stems growing in every direction, petals cascading through the air, and leaves scattered across the composition. “You can’t look at any one thing for any length of time, your eye is moving all over the place in continuous motion,” he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb518ec8-2806-11e6-8ba3-cdd781d02d89\">explained</a>. A remarkable 71 inches long, Katz’s <i>Red Tulips</i> (1967) is among the artist’s top auction records, selling for $690,600 at Sotheby’s in 2007.</p>",

Developing his mastery of the technique through residencies at legendary print shops such as Tamarind Institute, Universal Limited Art Editions, and Gemini G.E.L., Francis—along with fellow post-war artists like Helen Frankenthaler, Robert Motherwell, and Cy Twombly—helped turn this era into a printmaking renaissance. Captivated by the lithography medium in particular, Francis even opened his own workshop in Santa Monica in 1970, The Litho Shop, where he created works that drew from his fascination with Zen Buddhism (emphasizing the void), Jungian psychology (exploring themes from his interior life), and Japanese aesthetics (practicing calligraphic strokes inspired by his time living in Tokyo).</p>",

Released just four years before Albers’s death, “Formulation: Articulation” is often regarded as a capstone to the artist’s long career, spanning his early works at the Bauhaus in the 1930s until his tenure at Yale. Notably, Albers chose to arrange the prints out of chronological order, favoring a lineup that focused on color relationships. The portfolio, released in an edition of 1,000, is in the permanent collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, SFMOMA, the British Museum, and the Stedelijk Museum, among other institutions. While the prints in “Formulation: Articulation” are often sold individually, rare examples of the full portfolio occasionally come to the market.</p>",

His fixation on celebrities only continued when he moved to New York to become an illustrator for <i>Glamour</i> magazine and endured through his career as a Pop artist. Starlets, politicians, athletes—Warhol captured them all. “I’ll paint anybody. Anybody that asks me. I just try to make people look good,” he once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/06/andywarhol.art\">said</a>. To create his portraits, Warhol used a semi-mechanized silkscreen process that allowed him to mass-produce images of his subjects. Critics have long observed that his technique mirrors the nature of celebrity itself, where icons like <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/andy-warhol-mick-jagger\">Mick Jagger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/andy-warhol-marilyn-monroe\">Marilyn Monroe</a>, Judy Garland, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/andy-warhol-elvis-presley\">Elvis Presley</a> have become commodities to be bought and sold.</p>",

So the 77-year-old artist found a local printer and began experimenting with a new technique: linocuts, a relief printing method that involves carving directly into a sheet of linoleum. Drawn to the speed of the medium, Picasso created over 100 linocuts over the next five years. <i>Portrait of a Woman after Cranach the Younger</i> (1958), <i>Portrait of a Woman in a Hat</i> (1962), and <i>Still Life with Glass Under the Lamp</i> (1962) are some of the most popular linocuts from this period, regularly selling in the five and six figures at auction. </p>",

Warhol, who began his series of <a href=\"http://artsy.net/collection/andy-warhol-celebrity-portraits\">celebrity portraits</a> just a year prior, scoured newspapers and magazines for images relating to the tragedy. In the end, he found himself most inspired by eight photographs of the former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy: two photographs before the assassination that showed Jackie smiling in her iconic pink Chanel suit and pillbox hat, two that captured her grief-stricken face during the swearing in of Lyndon B. Johnson, and four more from her husband’s funeral. Over the following year, Warhol transformed these images into over 300 silkscreen paintings, often choosing palettes of blue and black to reflect the colors of the television.</p>",

Created between 1964 and 1987, Warhol’s numerous self-portraits trace the Pop artist’s rise from a self-conscious emerging talent to a celebrity-obsessed starlet to an aging man haunted by the possibility of death. Warhol often portrayed himself with a sense of vulnerability—a departure from his glamorous, idealized portraits of celebrities. Many of his self-portraits contain explicit symbols of mortality, such as skulls or ghostly facial expressions. Created just months before his own death, Warhol’s <i>Six Self-Portraits</i> (also known as <i>Freight Wigs</i>) portrays the artist with a skeletal face, gazing through hollow eyes at the viewer. Among the artist’s most popular self-portraits on the market, the full set of <i>Six Self-Portraits</i> broke its auction record in 2018, selling for over $31 million.</p>",

Working as a freelance children’s book illustrator, Warhol painted his feline companions in his spare time before casting them in a book of his own. In 1954, Warhol published a book of his cats accompanied by Julia’s calligraphy. The children’s book was titled (in incorrect grammar) <i>25 Cats Name Sam and One Blue Pussy</i>, and, incidentally, only contained 16 cats.

When Marshall’s “Scout” paintings were first exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum in 1998, <i>The New York Times</i> critic Holland Cotter described the groundbreaking nature of these images. “In these portraits, time-honored American values—community, leadership, duty—that were also the bedrock of the early civil rights movement, are reconfirmed and radically recast,” he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/02/arts/art-review-in-civil-rights-ferment-a-conflicted-nostalgia.html\">wrote</a>. While the “Scout” paintings now belong to permanent museum collections, collectors can bring home embroidered versions of these seminal images. Released by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles in 2017, these scout patches recreate six of Marshall’s “Scout” paintings in rayon thread: <i>Brownie</i> (1995), <i>Cub Scout</i> (1995), <i>Scout (Girl)</i> (1995), <i>Scout (Boy)</i> (1995), <i>Den Mother</i> (1996), and <i>Scout Master</i> (1996).</p>",

For this series, Hirst arranged the medicine according to their function on the human body—from migraine pills on the top shelf to foot cream on the bottom. In the years since, Hirst has made outsized sculptures of candy-colored pills and human-sized scalpels, as well as immersive installations that make the viewer feel like they’ve entered a working pharmacy. The works, which can be interpreted as a metaphor for the healing power of art, hold a special place in the artist’s heart. Perhaps most admired is <i>The Void</i> (2000), a mammoth glass shelf containing single pills arranged in a perfect grid. “I think it’s like the best piece I’ve ever made,” Hirst <a href=\"https://www.phillips.com/article/11599508/entering-the-void-hirsts-largest-pill-cabinet-exhibited-in-the-us\">said</a> of the installation.</p>",

Indeed, Nara’s puppy sculptures are often monumental in size, including his 27-foot-tall <i>Aomori-Ken</i> (2005) on permanent display the Aomori Museum of Art in Japan.

Chagall, who came from Belarusian-Jewish heritage, quickly packed his bags for Palestine, hoping to find inspiration in the Holy Land. The resulting series, “The Bible,” spanned 25 years and two volumes, showing parables and figures from the Old and New Testaments in 105 etchings. “The Bible” was originally released as a portfolio, in an edition of 295 in black-and-white and 100 hand-colored and signed by the artist. These works—alongside the artist’s later series “Drawings for the Bible” (1958–1960)—reflect Chagall’s ongoing interest in the beauty and tragedy of humanity: “The Bible is like an echo of nature and this secret I have tried to transmit,” he <a href=\"https://news.masterworksfineart.com/2017/07/11/marc-chagall-drawings-for-the-bible-series-1958-1960-color-lithographs\">explained</a>.</p>",

While living in Paris, Calder applied his training as a mechanical engineer to build small, mechanized circus figures that would fit easily inside a suitcase. Between 1926 and 1931, he built an entire circus troupe featuring more than 70 human and animal figures, as well as other carnival odds and ends like musical instruments, bubble-blowers, nets, flags, and carpets—filling five suitcases. These playful kinetic sculptures were built out of wire, wood, and found objects, and were hand-operated by Calder himself, who performed the circus for audiences of friends in Paris, including well-known artists like Marcel Duchamp, Joan Miró, and Piet Mondrian. <i>Calder’s Circus</i> is in the permanent collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art, but related works on paper and wire sketches are still available for collectors.</p>",

As part of their long-term collaborative practice of intervening in landscapes with fabric, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/christo\">Christo</a> and Jeanne-Claude originally conceived <i>The Gates</i> in 1979, but their proposal was quickly rejected by New York City officials. Years later, with the support of Mayor Bloomberg, the duo returned to their original plan. Using 7,503 fabric panels in varying widths, the couple lined 23 miles of walkways in Central Park for 16 days. Referencing both Japanese torii (Shinto structures that mark transitions into sacred spaces) and Central Park’s famous entrances (named “gates” by the park’s original designers), Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s brightly colored gates stood in stark contrast to the leafless, snowy park. In keeping with their belief in the urgency of temporary work, the duo ensured <i>The Gates</i> were quickly de-installed and all materials recycled. Despite the temporary nature of the project, many of Christo’s preparatory sketches for the project exist today.</p>",

Inspired by this childhood memory, Hirst began experimenting with the spin technique in earnest in 1992, the same year he was nominated for Britain’s prestigious Turner Prize. “Every time they’re finished, I’m desperate to do another one,” he <a href=\"http://www.damienhirst.com/texts1/series/spins\">once said</a> of his spin paintings. For Hirst, the chaotic, circular movement of these works represent life itself, and the accessibility of the spin painting technique showed that anyone can be an artist. The late rock legend David Bowie famously came to Hirst’s studio to collaborate on a spin painting in 1995.</p>",

When travel pulled Miró away from Marcoussis’s studio, he sent him letters about his budding interests in the medium. “My dear friend,” he <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_229_300087882.pdf\">wrote</a>, “I am in this beautiful country for a few days and am always thinking about this exciting technique of etching, which I will take up again as soon as I return, following your precious counsel.” Miró’s early etchings, produced during the turmoil of the Spanish Civil War, often explored a tension between darkness and color, incorporating different techniques such as aquatint and drypoint to heighten these contrasts. In 1967, Miró’s etching practice hit another breakthrough when he discovered that carborundum, an abrasive mineral, could give his prints even more depth and texture. These late carborundum prints are some of Miró’s most desirable etchings on the market, often selling in the high five-figure range at auction.</p>",

There, de Kooning discovered two oversized lithographic stones, each nearly four feet high, and a standard cleaning mop. In less than an hour, he slathered the cleaning tool across the stones to create two explosive images, titled <i>Waves I</i> and <i>Waves II</i>. A decade later, de Kooning revisited the lithography technique after a 1970 trip to Japan inspired him to create compositions reminiscent of Japanese calligraphy and Sumi ink painting. Upon return, he began his most generative year in printmaking, collaborating with the master printmaker Irwin Hollander to create 24 black-and-white lithographs reminiscent of dripped and splashed ink.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In 1955, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/yves-klein\">Yves Klein</a> had his first public showing of his monochrome oil paintings, presenting a new and controversial form of abstraction that only featured a single color. At the Club des Solitaires in Paris, Klein adorned the walls with intensely vibrant canvases in colors like magenta, yellow, red, and blue. His objective, to fully reject representation in art, was completely misunderstood by the audience, even a year later when Klein presented these works again at Galerie Colette Allendy. These early viewers interpreted the works as a splashy new style of interior decorating. Klein, disappointed but not deterred, instead turned further toward monochrome, later calling the style an “open window to freedom.” He worked with a chemist to formulate and patent his very own color for these paintings—a strikingly saturated ultramarine blue, which he named International Klein Blue (IKB). Satisfied with the color’s ability to transcend the material world, Klein spent the rest of his career creating monochrome canvases, reliefs, sculptures, furniture, and even balloons in this signature color.</p>",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/andy-warhol\">Andy Warhol</a> earned the nickname “Drella”—a combination of Dracula and Cinderella—from one of his associates, who believed the Pop artist’s personality was split between these two fictional characters. In 1990, the Velvet Underground named its tribute album for Andy Warhol, <i>Songs for Drella</i>, after this playful moniker. But Warhol’s fascination with Dracula began long before the nickname stuck. In 1963, Warhol found inspiration in Tod Browning’s 1931 silent film of <i>Dracula</i>, turning a pivotal scene from the film into one of his first silkscreen prints, <i>The Kiss (Bela Lugosi)</i>. That same year, Warhol began shooting his own Dracula-inspired movie with his Bolex camera, returning to the subject a decade later when he produced the cult classic, sexually explicit film <i>Blood for Dracula</i> in 1974. In 1981, Warhol created perhaps his most iconic interpretation of Dracula as part of his “<a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/andy-warhol-myths\">Myths</a>” portfolio, portraying the blood-sucking vampire in a haunting palette of black and pink.</p>",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/john-baldessari\">John Baldessari</a> has long been fascinated by what differentiates a part from a whole, especially when his subject is the human body. To examine this distinction, the pioneering conceptual artist often portrays an isolated feature of the body—a floating nose or a raised eyebrow, for example—over and over again, reproducing the motif in a variety of colors, mediums, and sizes. As its title suggests, “Raised Eyebrows/Furrowed Foreheads” is a series that focuses on the area between the eyes and the hairline, challenging viewers to determine whether these facial features are a part or a whole. The alarmed expression in “Raised Eyebrows/Furrowed Foreheads” was also a timely call to action. Baldessari released these sculptures and prints in 2008 and 2009, a time when the economic recession was in full swing. “Aren’t we all worried? These works may be viewed as depicting that condition,” he <a href=\"https://www.mariangoodman.com/exhibitions/raised-eyebrows-furrowed-foreheads/press-release\">noted</a>.</p>",

Often overlooked in the artist’s catalog is his return to Biblical imagery, which he embraced in 1942 after announcing his return to the Catholic faith and a subsequent shift toward a traditional style of painting. Though Dalí was raised Catholic in Catalonia, Spain, he renounced the religion during his creative embrace of Surrealism in the 1920s and ’30s, preferring to draw upon mysticism found in Freudian psychology and Einstein’s theory of relativity. But Dalí later found himself drawn back to the Catholic faith through the growing field of nuclear physics, believing advances in the field provided proof of God’s existence. Dalí created monumental versions of major Biblical scenes, including <i>Crucifixion</i> (1954) and <i>The Sacrament of the Last Supper</i> (1955), and even produced an illustrated version of the Bible in 1964 called <i>Biblia Sacra</i>. Today, collectors can find limited edition etchings, lithographs, and works on paper that showcase Dalí’s takes on iconic scenes from the Old and New Testaments.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Throughout his career, the street artist <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/shepard-fairey\">Shepard Fairey</a> has shared his graphic style and political message with the public by designing posters. Fairey’s poster obsession began as a teenager. In high school, he would borrow his mother’s Xerox machine to copy logos from skateboarding magazines and plaster them across town. As an art school student in 1989, Fairey created a poster titled <em>Obey Giant</em> that unexpectedly went viral, featuring the seven-foot tall boxer <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/shepard-fairey-andre-the-giant\">André the Giant</a>. Fairey’s fame skyrocketed once again in 2008 when he launched his iconic red, white, and blue <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/shepard-fairey-barack-obama\">“Hope” posters</a> to support Barack Obama’s presidential campaign. From the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/shepard-fairey-peace-signs\">“Peace Guard” posters</a> boycotting violence and war abroad to the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/shepard-fairey-we-the-people\">“We the People” prints</a> launched for the Women’s March in 2017, Fairey’s posters often promote activism by spreading a message of unity.</p>",
