    "description": "<p>Brian Donnelly, the ex-Disney illustrator better known as <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/kaws\">KAWS</a>, created his first vinyl toy in 1999: an eight-inch “<a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/kaws-companions\">Companion</a>” whose round belly, noodly limbs, and white gloves immediately reminded viewers of the cartoons made famous by his former workplace. The limited edition toy, produced in collaboration with the Japanese brand Bounty Hunter, reflected KAWS’s desire to make his work more accessible to the public. In the years since, KAWS has rendered most of his signature characters in three dimensions, including Chum, Bendy, and Blitz, as well as his renditions of iconic cartoons like Tweety, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/kaws-snoopy\">Snoopy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection//kaws-pinocchio\">Pinocchio</a>. When first released, these sculptures often sell out in just seconds. When the Museum of Modern Art promoted KAWS’s toys in its design store, collector demand was so high that the museum’s website crashed multiple times.</p>",

    "description": "<p>As a memorial to the late starlet, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/andy-warhol\">Andy Warhol</a> created his first portrait of Marilyn Monroe, <i>Marilyn Diptych</i>, in the months after the actress tragically passed away in August 1962. Warhol revisited her image five years later, presenting 10 reproductions of the actress in high-contrast hues for his iconic “Marilyn Monroe” suite. Modeled after a publicity image of Monroe from the 1953 film <i>Niagara</i>, the <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/andy-warhol-portraits\">portraits</a> are a quintessential example of Warhol’s obsession with celebrity culture and repetition. The suite also marked a turning point in Warhol’s career as he embraced silkscreen printing—a technique that allowed him to mass-produce images of his muses, erasing the imperfections that made them human in the process. Warhol is often credited with making an idol out of Monroe, immortalizing her in youthful beauty for future generations.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In 1954, two years after being discharged from the United States Army, the 24-year-old <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/jasper-johns\">Jasper Johns</a> had a vivid dream of the American flag. The next morning, Johns gathered the materials to bring this dream to canvas, creating an encaustic version of the U.S. flag with hot wax, paint, fabric, and collaged newspapers. Johns would go on to return to the flag more than 40 times throughout his career, sometimes in its signature tri-color palette and others in muted gray and white monochromes. The resulting images are among the most celebrated works in American art, and made Johns one of the best-selling artists of all time. Johns’s flags are now in the permanent collections of the MoMA, the Whitney, and the Tate—though related works on paper can still be collected today. In 2010, <i>Flag</i> (1958), previously owned by Johns’ gallerist Leo Castelli, sold for $110 million to a private collection, making it one of the most expensive works ever sold.</p>",

Of the 27,000 images Frank shot on his journey documenting the nation, 83 black-and-white photographs were chosen for his seminal monograph <i>The Americans</i>. Published in 1959 with an introduction by beatnik legend Jack Kerouac, the collection has had <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-robert-franks-the-americans-matters-today\">seismic effects</a> on American art and culture to this day. Frank’s haunting images reveal a nation troubled by racism, classism, and an American dream that remains stubbornly inaccessible for many. <i>The Americans</i> inspired a generation of street photographers in the 1960s and ’70s who prioritized chance encounters and the universal narratives they could reveal through their subjects.</p>",

In the Surrealist master’s prints, sculptures, and paintings, elephants have long, spindly, multi-jointed legs that appear structurally incapable of supporting the animal’s body. Although realistically-proportioned elephants are depicted in Dalí’s <i>Swans Reflecting Elephants</i> (1937), his iconic long-legged fantastical beasts were first seen in the artist’s painting <i>Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening</i> (1944). They would later appear in paintings <i>The Temptation of St. Anthony</i> (1946), and Elephants</i> (1948), often towering over strange, barren landscapes. As with many of the recurring images in his work, such as his famous melting clocks, Dalí has transformed the noble elephant into a dream-like creature that seems fragile and ephemeral.</p>",

In 1932, bored by the monotony of mechanized movement, Calder introduced a new element of chance to his mobiles. Without an internal motor, his abstract forms responded to wind or gentle touch, each floating element moving independently and constantly creating new arrangements. Inspired by <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/piet-mondrian\">Piet Mondrian</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/joan-miro\">Joan Miró</a>, Calder created simple curvilinear constructions in wood and metal, conjuring images of skeletons, tree branches, and celestial bodies. When MoMA acquired its first Calder in 1934, the institution paid a humble $60. Eighty years later, Calder’s large-scale mobile <i>Poisson Volant</i> sold at Christie’s for a record $25.9 million.</p>",

Like KAWS’s signature “<a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/kaws-companions\">Companion</a>” figures, <i>BFF</i> has crossed-out eyes, gloved hands, and oversized ears. But <i>BFF</i>’s furry exterior—reminiscent of the woolly texture of Sesame Street’s Elmo—was unprecedented for the street artist, whose sculptures typically had a smooth finish. To celebrate this public installation, KAWS released 1,000 plush versions of the character, which sold out in just two and a half hours. One year later, KAWS designed a vinyl blue <i>BFF</i> in collaboration with the MoMA design store—once again, it was met with viral success, driving so much traffic to the museum’s website that it crashed. In the years since, the family of <i>BFFs</i> has only grown: vinyl standing <i>BFFs</i> in black and pink, a blue seated <i>BFF</i> that doubles as a glow-in-the-dark lamp, large-scale public sculptures in Los Angeles and Hunan, China, and a plush pink <i>BFF</i> clad in a Dior suite to celebrate the brand’s 2018 showing at Paris Fashion Week.</p>",

The design’s appeal was timeless, yet also emblematic of the idealistic and free-loving 1960s. As art legend has it, Indiana was first bemused and later conflicted about the instant runaway success of his design, worried that it may have ruined his reputation among the art world elite as a one-hit wonder. Despite the artist’s private insecurities, “LOVE” remains one of the most treasured works in 20th-century American sculpture—breaking $4.1 million at auction in 2011.</p>",

These melting clocks, sometimes referred to as soft or droopy watches, make repeated appearances throughout Dalí’s career, generating a variety of interpretations. Some scholars associate this symbol with the omnipresence of time and its mastery over humans. Others believe Dalí’s melting clocks are a symbol for Albert Einstein’s groundbreaking Theory of Relativity, while some art historians attribute Dalí’s inspiration to a much simpler moment: when the artist watched cheese melt in the sun.</p>",

Beginning with a photograph of himself, Close divides the portrait into a grid and then transfers, cell by cell, the image onto a larger matrix. The first work completed with this technique was <i>Big Self-Portrait</i> (1968), a massive black-and-white depiction of the artist with a cigarette hanging from his lips. Studies for his paintings and prints have become celebrated works on their own, showing both the artist’s working process and the virtuosity of his skill when compared with the final product. Close works in a variety of styles and mediums, often taking advantage of the grid, giving his self-portraits the appearance of <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/chuck-close-self-portrait-2032\">pixelation</a>, or even <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/chuck-close-self-portrait-45\">abstraction</a>.

Silkscreens from that exhibition have since sold for over $2 million at auction.

Even in his most abstract portraits, Picasso captures his sitters’ personalities. For example, his cubist portrait of his friend and art dealer <i><a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artwork/pablo-picasso-portrait-of-art-dealer-ambroise-vollard-1867-1939\">Ambroise Vollard</a></i> (1910), shows the figure broken down into geometric, angled shapes, although the viewer can still discover that Vollard was a serious and somewhat gruff individual with his downcast eyes and frown. Picasso is also famous for his portraits of his lovers, which often distort their features into playful abstractions. His sultry sleeping portrait of Marie-Thérèse Walter, <i>Le Rêve</i> (1932) is among the world’s most expensive paintings ever sold, reaching $155 million through a private sale in 2013. Regarding his outlook on portraiture, Picasso was often elusive. “When you start with a portrait and search for a pure form, a clear volume, through successive eliminations, you arrive inevitably at the egg,” he once said, “Likewise, starting with the egg and following the same process in reverse, one finishes with the portrait.”</p>",

The motif made its debut in 1962 when Warhol mounted his first solo show featuring 32 canvases painted with Campbell’s Soup Cans—one for each flavor the company sold at the time. But the cans weren’t instantly beloved as they are now. Most critics snubbed the work for its commercial and mundane subject matter, and when the show closed, the gallery’s owner Irving Blum <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-la-gallerist-bought-warhols-first-painting-1-000-ended-15-million\">purchased</a> the entire collection for $1,000.

Created between 1964 and 1987, Warhol’s numerous self-portraits trace the Pop artist’s rise from a self-conscious emerging talent to a celebrity-obsessed starlet to an aging man haunted by the possibility of death. Warhol often portrayed himself with a sense of vulnerability—a departure from his glamorous, idealized <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/andy-warhol-portraits\">portraits</a> of celebrities. Many of his self-portraits contain explicit symbols of mortality, such as skulls or ghostly facial expressions. Created just months before his own death, Warhol’s <i>Six Self-Portraits</i> (also known as <i>Freight Wigs</i>) portrays the artist with a skeletal face, gazing through hollow eyes at the viewer. Among the artist’s most popular self-portraits on the market, the full set of <i>Six Self-Portraits</i> broke its auction record in 2018, selling for over $31 million.</p>",

To spread this message of hope, Banksy released limited edition prints of <i>Girl with Balloon</i> in 2003, reproduced the image in the West Bank in 2005, and projected the motif onto the Eiffel Tower to spread awareness about the Syrian conflict in 2014 (a showing that inspired Justin Bieber to get a tattoo of <i>Girl with Balloon</i> on his arm). <i>Girl with Balloon</i> is now best known for a 2018 spectacle at Sotheby’s auction house, where a 2006 painting of the image self-destructed through a shredder embedded in its frame after selling for over $1 million. “We got Banksy-ed,” Alex Branczik, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art in Europe <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/news/artsy-editorial-artwork-banksy-shredded-selling-13-million-sothebys\">said</a> after the spectacle.</p>",

For the British Pop artist, California’s poolside culture was a new form of paradise, filled with glistening chlorine waters and lounging socialites. Hockney’s utopian depictions of swimming pools often featured scenes of gay domestic life—and this marked a sharp contrast to the artist’s experience in England where homosexuality was still illegal. For example, Hockney’s <i>Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)</i> (1972) showcases the couple Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy, meeting at the pool with an idyllic backdrop of rolling hills behind them. This seminal painting earned Hockney the title of the most expensive living artist in November 2018, selling for $90.3 million with fees.</p>",

The Pop artist typically paints cakes, pastries, and pies from memory, evoking nostalgia for mid-20th-century American diner culture and his adolescent days spent working in restaurants. But Thiebaud never expected his confectionary paintings and prints to become icons of American art. “Look, a row of pies—that’ll be the end of me trying to be a serious artist,” he <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/10/oldies-goodies\">remembers</a> thinking. “But I couldn’t leave it alone. It meant something to me.” But Thiebaud didn’t draw a line at these sugar-dusted confections—the artist also portrayed salty snacks like olives, sardines, and deli meats through works on paper. Whether savory or sweet, Thiebaud’s playful depictions of food capture a distinct moment in American ready-made culture of the 1950s and ’60s.</p>",

Kusama’s signature dotted pumpkins have since appeared as works on paper, handheld figurines, towering sculptures, and in the artist’s immersive infinity room installations. To Kusama, the pumpkins are warm and humorous motifs with figures that, at times, feel human. “I was enchanted by their charming and winsome form,” Kusama once <a href=\"http://www.thecallalilydialogues.com/the-dialogues/2015/6/2/the-polka-dot-super-star-yayoi-kusama\">said</a>. “What appealed to me most was the pumpkin’s generous unpretentiousness.”</p>",

Warhol hired multiple assistants and made dozens of sculptures at a time, using plywood and silkscreen ink to mimic the commercial manufacturing of actual cardboard Brillo boxes. For their first exhibition at Stable Gallery in 1964, the <i>Brillo Boxes</i> were stacked around the gallery like supermarket displays. Warhol envisioned dozens of gallery-goers carrying out his <i>Brillo Boxes</i> as if they were on a grocery run. Although his vision didn’t quite pan out at the time, <i>Brillo Box</i> is now one of Warhol’s most iconic works—fetching over $3 million at auction in 2010.</p>",

The British artist debuted this motif when he was 26 years old, with his ambitious installation “In and Out of Love”(1991). To showcase the insects’ short lifespan, Hirst invited viewers to watch butterflies emerge from their cocoons, fly around the gallery space, and die before the show’s end. Decades after this career-defining exhibition, Hirst remains fascinated by butterflies. He’s arranged their wings into psychedelic patterns in his kaleidoscope paintings, turned them into stained glass windows in his cathedral prints, presented them neatly in rows for his entomology cabinets, and more. “You have to find universal triggers,” the artist <a href=\"http://www.damienhirst.com/texts1/series/butterfly-colour-paintings\">explains</a>, “Everyone’s frightened of glass, everyone’s frightened of sharks, everyone loves butterflies.”</p>",

Over the next eight years, Haring created over 80 unique posters, from corporate advertisements for Absolut and Lucky Strike to cultural announcements for the Montreux Jazz Festival and the World Breakdance Championship. Haring also used posters as a means for social activism, spreading awareness about the crack cocaine epidemic in the United States, apartheid in South Africa, global nuclear disarmament, and the devastation of AIDS—a disease Haring would eventually face. Together, these posters feature nearly all of Haring’s signature icons, including his radiant baby, flying angel, and barking dog.</p>",

Using silkscreen printing, Warhol was able to produce many versions of the portrait, changing only the color palette. Warhol’s <i>Mao</i> transformed a serious portrait of a world leader into a provocatively playful and colorful image, with some renditions depicting Mao wearing eyeshadow, blush, or lipstick. It was Warhol’s longtime dealer, Bruno Bischofberger, who first suggested that he create a portrait of the most important figure of the 20th century. Fascinated by fame and celebrity culture, Warhol had recently read in <i>Life</i> magazine that Mao Zedong was the most famous person in the world, making him an appealing subject. <i>Mao</i> is among Warhol’s most popular portraits: The auction record for the work is $47.5 million, sold at Sotheby’s in 2015.</p>",

For three years, Warhol drew shoes for advertisements, a cultural symbol that would fascinate him throughout his career. The stately high-heeled shoe, usually depicted in profile, was Warhol’s favorite, which he portrayed in a range of colors and materials. Early drawings of shoes often featured cheeky captions written by his mother, Julia Warhola, such as “Uncle Sam wants shoe” or “You can lead a shoe to water, but you can’t make it drink.” Later shoes appear stylized in Warhol’s signature silkscreen prints, some of which famously incorporate diamond dust for added sparkle. Intended to mimic advertisements, Warhol’s shoes are emblematic of his interests in commercialism and reproduction.</p>",

An avid portraitist throughout his entire career, David Hockney has painted, drawn, or printed hundreds of portraits since the mid-1960s. Frequently drawn to the same subjects, Hockney often depicts himself or his relatives, friends, and employees—many of whom are famous artists, fashion designers, and dancers. In 2013, he dove into an intensive period of portraiture, producing 82 paintings over the course of three years, featuring titans of the art world like architect Frank Gehry and art dealer Larry Gagosian. Hockney depicted each of his subjects in the same setting—sitting on a yellow armchair against a blue or green background—in order to better highlight their unique qualities. Hockney’s portraits are also fitting bookends to his presence in the art market. His first painting ever sold was a portrait of his father from 1955. In November 2018, his <i>Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)</i> (1972), featuring his former lover Peter Schlesinger, turned him into the most expensive living artist, selling for $90.3 million with fees at Christie’s.</p>",

For the project, Matisse re-envisioned the circling nude dancers of his brightly colored <i>Joy of Life</i> (1906), in a pared-down palette and simplified lines. This monumental canvas, though completed in just one week and considered a study by Matisse, is among the most significant works of 20th-century art, now held in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In the 1920s, Matisse’s obsession with dancers continued. He met the ballerina Henriette Darricarrère who became his most beloved muse, depicting her again and again in paintings, etchings, lithography, and works on paper. Her sculpted body and ability to transform herself into dozens of characters mesmerized Matisse for over seven years, providing an essential study of the human form for the artist.</p>",

The simple design, a cartoon-like drawing outlined in black and often colored in yellow, was adopted by Basquiat from greater street art culture in the 1980s—the three-pointed crown was historically used as a tag to show respect for another artist’s work. Basquiat borrowed the motif for his own politically-charged visual language, transforming the crown into a symbol of Black power and excellence. Whether sitting atop a head or floating in space, the crown signified monarchy and ascendence. Adorning images of himself, Basquiat mimicked royal portraiture from European art history and anointed himself king. After Basquiat’s death in 1988 at the age of 27, the artist <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/keith-haring\">Keith Haring</a> created a painting in tribute to his friend: <i>A Pile of Crowns, for Jean-Michel Basquiat</i>—and in the years since, the crown has become an interchangeable symbol for the artist himself.</p>",

The “Weeping Women” are Picasso’s take on the Mater Dolorosa (Latin for “Sorrowful Mother”), which historically depicts a tearful Virgin Mary over the body of her dead son—though the twisted features of Picasso’s tortured figures were based on his muse and mistress Dora Maar, a raven-haired photographer he often called his own weeping woman. Picasso’s paintings and works on paper depict her features as agonized knots of cubist shapes, and they remain highly sought after. In 2011, a 1937 etching of a suffering Maar fetched $5.1 million at a Christie’s auction.</p>",

Depicting the rock star in a variety of poses, the portraits feature abstract swaths of opaque color, sometimes obscuring the singer’s face, giving the prints a collage-like appearance. Warhol and Jagger met in 1964, when the Rolling Stones were relatively unknown in the United States. Their creative collaboration was solidified when Jagger asked Warhol to design the album cover for <i>Sticky Fingers</i> (1971). Ever the provocateur, Warhol’s album cover design featured the image of a man’s denim-clad crotch with an exposed zipper.  </p>",

He approached a group of glamorous drag queens, asking them if they’d be willing to model for “a friend” for $50. That friend happened to be <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/andy-warhol\">Andy Warhol</a>, who later photographed the queens just like any of his other iconic muses—at a three-fourths angle with his Polaroid camera. Of these <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/andy-warhol-polaroids\">Polaroids</a>, Warhol chose 10 photographs for his silkscreen series “Ladies and Gentlemen,” which portray the queens as confident, coy, and vulnerable. Fascinated by the queens’ exhibitionism and meticulous grooming, Warhol once mused, “They do all the things: They think about shaving and not shaving, of primping and not primping, of buying men’s clothes and women’s clothes. I guess it’s interesting to try to be another sex.”</p>",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/andy-warhol\">Andy Warhol</a>’s 1981 “Myths” portfolio is among the artist’s most sought-after print series. The 10 silkscreens showcase a variety of fictional characters, from Santa Claus to Superman, that Warhol viewed as essential components of American culture. While Warhol often used found images for his <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/andy-warhol-portraits\">portraits</a> of celebrities, he took a different approach for the “Myths” portfolio. The Pop artist invited friends and actors into his studio to pose for his Polaroid camera, dressed up as Dracula, Uncle Sam, the mammy archetype, and the Wicked Witch of the West from the film <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>. Warhol even cast himself as The Shadow, the crime-fighting hero made famous by a series of novels, radio, and comic strips. These <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/collection/andy-warhol-polaroids\">Polaroids</a> and the resulting silkscreens—released in a variety of colors with some adorned with diamond dust—are quintessential Warhols, showcasing the power and persuasion of popular culture. “Everybody has their own America,” the Pop artist once <a href=\"https://www.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2016/july/04/when-warhol-painted-uncle-sam/\">explained</a>. “You live in your dream America that you’ve custom-made from art and schmaltz and emotions just as much as you live in your real one.”</p>",

Bochner’s conceptual work invites viewers to investigate the differences between “seeing” and “reading” art, superimposing words and colors in combinations that make viewers pause. For example, the Conceptual artist will cover canvases in obscenities painted in innocent hues of baby pink and blue or sweet words rendered in soiled browns and inky blacks. Bochner is perhaps most celebrated for his “Thesaurus” pieces that feature lists of synonyms—such as “Amazing! Awesome! Breathtaking!”—and encourage viewers to think about their day-to-day word choices. This series began when Bochner was in his twenties, creating word-based portraits of his friends and fellow burgeoning artists Eva Hesse, Robert Smithson, and Dan Flavin.</p>",

    "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/pablo-picasso\">Pablo Picasso</a> became enamored by ceramics in 1946, when the 60-year-old artist stumbled upon a pottery fair near his summer home in the South of France. There, Picasso met the owners of the Madoura Pottery workshop and began a collaboration with the studio that lasted until his death in 1973. Picasso, known for his prolific output, designed 633 different ceramic works, ranging from carved editioned plates to unique bird-shaped pitchers. Since Picasso created his ceramics while on holiday, his creations often feature a sense of joy and wit. Picasso also met his second wife, Jacqueline Roque, at the Madoura Pottery workshop, further contributing to his uplifting motifs during this time. Passionate about expanding his collector base, Picasso created many ceramics in large editions with accessible prices, though the market for some of his unique ceramics has since skyrocketed. <i>Le Hibou (Rouge et Blanc)</i> (1953), a one-of-a-kind earthenware sculpture of a patterned owl, set the auction record for Picasso’s ceramics, selling for over $2.4 million at Christie’s in 2016.</p>",

Rauschenberg’s posters are rarely legible at first glance and require repeat viewing to uncover their many hidden symbols and details. Composed of layered images and text, Rauschenberg’s first poster was a black-and-white advertisement for his first retrospective at the Jewish Museum in 1963, and he continued to create exhibition posters throughout his life. “We were doing a poster for every show, and those posters were going out all over the country, and people were thinking we must be this amazing gallery instead of a freight elevator,” Rauschenberg remembered of this era. Over the next 35 years, the artist created over 100 posters celebrating iconic historical moments, including the first landing on the moon and the first Earth Day, in his signature collage aesthetic.</p>",

In earlier days, when skateboarding was still a subculture on the fringe, simply being a skater was enough to set oneself apart from the crowd. However, the growing popularity of the sport pushed many creative skaters to find ways to individualize their boards. Borrowing from motifs and styles popularized by graffiti artists, skaters designed the undersides of their boards an extension of themselves. In the decades since, fine art, street art, and skate culture have become inseparable, with renowned artists like <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/keith-haring\">Keith Haring</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/shepard-fairey\">Shepard Fairey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/yayoi-kusama\">Yayoi Kusama</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artsy.net/artist/yoshitomo-nara\">Yoshitomo Nara</a> reproducing some of their most famous works on the decks of skateboards. </p>",

Indeed, Miró’s first prints were lithographs, a printmaking method that enables artists to draw directly on a stone slab or metal plate. Created in 1930, these early lithographs accompanied a book of poetry by Tristan Tzara and jumpstarted Miró’s lifelong love of the lithography technique. From from 1954 to 1958, Miró nearly gave up painting altogether to focus on these prints, earning him the Grand Prize for Graphic Work at the Venice Biennale in 1954. Some of Miró’s lithographs, such as his collaborations with the fine art publisher <i>Derrière le Miroir</i>, recreate his paintings on paper, while many others, such as his 1944 “Barcelona” series, are entirely new designs that explore the possibilities of the lithography technique.</p>",

The feminist artist began working with neon gas lights in the early 1990s, using the industrial medium to share her passing thoughts and her deepest desires. With her own messy handwriting as the font, Emin’s neon sculptures and prints feature phrases that are deeply personal, but also universally relatable, such as “I fell in love here” and “Trust yourself.” More recently, Emin has expanded the scale of her neon writings by installing them in public spaces with the goal of bringing strangers together. In 2013, to celebrate Valentine’s Day in New York City, Emin was commissioned to bring her romantic neon phrases to Time Square, flashing declarations like “I promise to love you” and “You touch my soul” to passersby. Five years later, Emin unveiled a 20-meter-long neon sculpture in London’s St. Pancras station, which read, “I want my time with you”—a political message intended for immigrants arriving in Britain amidst Brexit concerns and a European migrant crisis.</p>",
