Collect by Color: Black and White,collect-by-color-black-and-white,Contemporary,"<p>From the beginning of art history, artists have been drawn to the simple palette of black and white. Even <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/henri-matisse"">Henri Matisse</a>, a painter famous for his experimentation with color, believed in the power of neutrals. “I’ve been forty years discovering that the queen of all colors is black,” he famously said. For Matisse, along with many others, black and white works boast a certain timelessness, showcasing the impact of light and shadow.

Roy Lichtenstein: Still Lifes,roy-lichtenstein-still-lifes,Pop Art,"<p><a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/roy-lichtenstein"">Roy Lichtenstein</a> began painting still lifes in 1972, putting a cartoon-inspired spin on the centuries-old genre of portraying everyday objects in art. Lichtenstein, who was drawn to the art historical significance of the still life motif, filled his compositions with references to great artists of the past. In his prints and paintings, viewers can find guitars in the style of <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/pablo-picasso"">Pablo Picasso</a>, bowls of goldfish borrowed from <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/henri-matisse"">Henri Matisse</a>, peeled lemons popularized by the Dutch Old Masters of the 17th century, and more. But while Lichtenstein’s works might contain elements of art history, the Pop artist always asserted that his renditions were distinctly modern. “When we think of still lifes, we think of paintings that have a certain atmosphere or ambiance,” he once <a href=""https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2010/roy-lichtenstein-still-lifes/"">explained</a>. “My still life paintings have none of those qualities, they just have pictures of certain things that are in a still life, like lemons and grapefruits and so forth. It’s not meant to have the usual still life meaning.”</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/roylichtensteinstilllifes.png,"<p>Roy Lichtenstein, <i>Still life with crystal bowl</i>, 1976.

Roy Lichtenstein: Landscapes,roy-lichtenstein-landscapes,Pop Art,"<p>After spending the first few years of the 1960s painting scenes from comic books, <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/roy-lichtenstein"">Roy Lichtenstein</a> found himself enraptured by a new subject matter: landscapes. In 1964, the Pop artist created his first paintings of floating clouds, ocean tides, and rolling hills, drawing inspiration from the nature scenes often overlooked in the background of cartoon strips. Over the following decades, Lichtenstein continued to put his Pop art spin on landscape painting, choosing to portray scenes from nature that felt cliché or mass-produced. For example, his prints of ray-filled sunrises remind viewers of images found on travel postcards, while his versions of <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/claude-monet"">Claude Monet</a>’s haystack paintings reference the mass-production of these art historical masterpieces. For the final series of his career, Lichtenstein expanded his parody of traditional landscapes with <i>Landscapes in the Chinese Style</i> (1995–97), transforming the ethereal and expressive ink-and-wash paintings from China’s Song dynasty into dotted, mechanical compositions that appear computer-generated.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/roylichtensteinlandscapes.png,"<p>Roy Lichtenstein, <i>Moonscape from the 11 Pop Artist portfolio, Volume I</i>, 1965.

Roy Lichtenstein: The Surrealist Series,roy-lichtenstein-the-surrealist-series,Pop Art,"<p>In 1977, <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/roy-lichtenstein"">Roy Lichtenstein</a> entered his brief but impactful Surrealist period, finding inspiration in the absurdist works of <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/salvador-dali"">Salvador Dalí</a>, <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/rene-magritte"">Rene Magritte</a>, <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/max-ernst"">Max Ernst</a>, and <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/pablo-picasso"">Pablo Picasso</a>. Lichtenstein’s carefully planned compositions and cartoon aesthetic couldn’t be more different from the instinctive, dreamlike practices of the Surrealists—and the challenge of integrating these disparate styles intrigued him. For example, the Pop artist’s <i>Nude on Beach</i> (1978) portrays a blonde woman, composed entirely of graphic red stripes, melting on the beach—a reference to the <a href=""http://artsy.net/collection/salvador-dali-melting-clocks"">oozing clocks</a> in Dalí’s famous painting <i>The Persistence of Memory</i> (1931). While Lichtenstein revisited multiple art movements (including Art Deco, Futurism, Cubism, and German Expressionism) throughout his career, his Surrealist period is among his most commercially popular series. His painting <i>Landscape with Figures</i> (1977) reached $18 million with fees at Christie’s in 2014, while <i>Female Head</i> (1977) set a new record for the series at Sotheby’s in 2017, selling for over $24.5 million with fees.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/roylichtensteinsurrealism.png,"<p>Roy Lichtenstein, <i>Jobs Not Cheese!

Gerhard Richter: Abstractions ,gerhard-richter-squeegee-paintings-and-prints ,Abstract Art,"<p>In 1986, <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/gerhard-richter"">Gerhard Richter</a> discovered a new way to create abstractions. Instead of using paintbrushes, the German artist would use a janitorial squeegee to drag, smear, and scrape layers of wet paint across the canvas. “With a brush you have control,” Richter once explained. “The paint goes on the brush and you make the mark...with the squeegee you lose control.” The radical technique inspired filmmaker Corinna Belz to create her fly-on-the-wall documentary <i>Gerhard Richter Painting</i> (2011), combining three years of studio footage to capture the creation of these squeegee canvases. Among the artist’s most iconic series, Richter’s squeegee paintings have reached record sums at auction. In 2015, Richter earned the title of most expensive living European artist when his squeegee painting <i>Abstraktes Bild (599)</i> (1986) sold for over $46 million with fees at a Sotheby’s auction. Richter’s innovations in abstract art—from his early gridded paintings and color charts to his recent squeegee paintings and flowing compositions—have even inspired museum exhibitions, such as “Gerhard Richter: Abstraction” at Germany’s Museum Barberini in 2018.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/gerhardrichterabstractions.png,"<p>Gerhard Richter, <i>Haggadah (P2)</i>, 2014.

His fixation on celebrities only continued when he moved to New York to become an illustrator for <i>Glamour</i> magazine and endured through his career as a Pop artist. Starlets, politicians, athletes—Warhol captured them all. “I’ll paint anybody. Anybody that asks me. I just try to make people look good,” he once <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/oct/06/andywarhol.art"">said</a>. To create his portraits, Warhol used a semi-mechanized silkscreen process that allowed him to mass-produce images of his subjects.

For example, the British Pop artist often produced original posters to promote operas and ballets, especially when he designed the sets for these productions. Perhaps the most famous collector of David Hockney’s posters is Brian Baggott, a former British Airways employee who befriended Hockney in the 1970s. Since he could not afford an original painting or print, Baggot collected more than 200 posters by the artist over the course of 25 years. “I wrote to every gallery ever mentioned in the back of a Hockney catalogue to see if they’d done a poster,” he once <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/14/arts/art-architecture-affordable-hockney-playing-the-promoter.html"">explained</a>. “It had become a bit of an obsession, rather like schoolboys with stamps.” In 1999, his obsession paid off—Baggott’s collection of Hockney posters sold for over $100,000 at a Christie’s auction.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/davidhockneyposters.png,"<p>David Hockney, <i>Retrospective 1988</i>, 1988.

It’s like psychoanalysis.” Longo began drawing towering waves in 1999, using his signature hyperrealistic technique to transform black-and-white charcoal into thunderous ocean forms. At this time, Longo was fascinated by phenomena that only seem to exist for an instant, such as crashing waves, prowling sharks, and exploding bombs. By capturing these moments in precise detail, Longo aimed to add a sense of beauty to these sublime yet terrifying forces of nature. While Longo titled his series of wave drawings “Monsters” after their intimidating grandeur, he also named each individual work after a popular surfing beach or phrase, such as <i>Angel’s Wing</i>, <i>Hell’s Gate</i>, <i>Dragon Head</i>, and <i>Black Tube</i>.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/robert-longo-wave.png,"<p>Robert Longo, <i>Wave</i>, 2003.

Richard Anuszkiewicz: Translumina Series,richard-anuszkiewicz-rranslumina-series,Abstract Art,"<p>In the “Translumina Series,” <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/richard-anuszkiewicz"">Richard Anuszkiewicz</a> turned to sculptural materials like wood relief, aluminum and steel sheets, and bronze tubing for the first time. Working in three dimensions, Anuszkiewicz constructed shaped canvases for his optical illusions, painting them with thin stripes of interweaving colors to create a sense of vibration in the viewer’s eye. “The ideas I work on are essentially timeless,” the artist once said. “Working with basic ideas will always be exciting, and if color or form is visually exciting in any profound sense, it will be that way ten or twenty years from now also.” Anuskiewitz also reimagined the “basic ideas” of the “Translumina Series” as prints, transforming many of the sculptural compositions into silkscreens. In 1986, the artist even created a “Translumina” print for one of his “Annuals” gifts—a series of prints that he would give to friends and family each year and would not sell to the public.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/richard-anuszkiewicz-translumina.png,"<p>Richard Anuszkiewicz, <i>Translumina – Midnight II</i>, 1994–2012.

Today, Salvador Dalí’s most celebrated Surrealist symbols—<a href=""https://www.artsy.net/collection/salvador-dali-melting-clocks"">melting clocks</a>, <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/collection/salvador-dali-horses"">horses</a>, eyes, angels, and more—can be discovered cast in bronze, with designs often directly inspired by his own paintings and prints. In addition to his bronze sculptures, Dalí had a penchant for creating bronze designs for the home, including chairs, clocks, menorahs, lamps, and tables. Many of his furniture designs bring motifs from his paintings to life. For example, his sinuous Leda armchair is meticulously crafted from his 1935 painting, <i>Femme á la Téte Rose</i>, which showcases the delicate, three-legged chair in the foreground.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/salvador-dali-bronze.png,"<p>&copy; Salvador Dalí / Artist Rights Society (ARS), New York, NY.</p>",4dadcce67129f059240009df,Bronze,,,,
James Rosenquist: Tripartite Series,james-rosenquist-tripartite-series,Pop Art,"<p>Drawn to the teachings of the Zen philosopher Sengai Gibon, <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/james-rosenquist"">James Rosenquist</a> believed that the world could be entirely represented with three simple shapes: the circle, the triangle, and the square. As Zen teaching goes, the circle represents infinite and the basis of life itself, the triangle symbolizes the beginning of all forms, and the square—the triangle doubled—manifests the multiplicity of forms that comprise the entire multidimensional universe. Rosenquist’s “Tripartite Series” of etchings and lithographs cheekily reappropriates this Zen trifecta with a distinctly American spin, engaging with the artist’s long-time themes of technology, commercialism, and American culture. In Rosenquist’s “Tripartite” prints, circles bloom into spoked wheels and warp into cosmic bodies, triangles become Egyptian pyramids or overlap to form the Star of David, and squares transform into cookie-cutter houses fit for the American dream. Created during the 1970s at the peak of the artist’s immersion in printmaking, Rosenquist’s “Tripartite Series” spans dozens of prints, each encoded with distinct references of American life.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/james-rosenquist-etching.png,"<p>James Rosenquist, <i>SPOKES</i>, 1997.

Pablo Picasso: Honoré de Balzac,pablo-picasso-honore-de-balzac,Modern,"<p><a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/pablo-picasso"">Pablo Picasso</a> was so enamored by the works of the 19th-century writer and playwright Honoré de Balzac that the artist even believed himself to be haunted by Balzac’s ghost. Picasso’s fascination with the Frenchman bordered on obsession—when Picasso needed a new studio in 1937, he chose to move into a 17th-century townhouse at 7 Rue des Grands-Augustin in Paris, the very same flat where Balzac sets the opening scene to his macabre story, <i>The Hidden Masterpiece</i>. Throughout his career, Picasso paid homage to the writer—from cheeky illustrations for Balzac’s short story <i>Le Chef-d’œuvre Inconnu</i> to lithographs portraying Balzac in caricature. Knowing the artist’s soft spot for the writer, in 1954 the Paris-based printing workshop Verve commissioned the artist to illustrate Balzac’s masterwork, <i>La Comédie Humaine</i>. Picasso sketched dozens of playful vignettes of post-Napoleonic French life, which he also produced as color lithographs and black-and-white heliogravures.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/pablo-picasso-honore-de-balzac.png,"<p>&copy; Pablo Picasso / Artist Rights Society (ARS), New York, NY.</p>",4d8b928b4eb68a1b2c0001f2,,,"Balzac, La Comédie Humaine, Le Chef-d’œuvre Inconnu",,

Joan Mitchell: Lithographs,joan-mitchell-lithographs,Abstract Art,"<p>In 1981, <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/joan-mitchell"">Joan Mitchell</a> traveled to New York to collaborate with the esteemed printmaker Kenneth Tyler, who had convinced the Abstract Expressionist that the most fitting printmaking technique for her gestural style was lithography. While Mitchell’s earlier prints, mostly silkscreens and etchings, were typically dull or neutral in color, her first series of lithographs were vibrant, filled with cobalt blues, lime greens, and neon yellows. Some prints would feature as many as 10 different hues. “Don’t give me any of your gooey guck colors,” Tyler <a href=""https://kennethtylercollection.net/2010/09/15/joan-mitchell-the-blueness-of-blue/"">remembers</a> Mitchell telling him in the studio. A decade later, Mitchell collaborated with Tyler—who had become one of her lifelong friends—on a second portfolio of lithographs. For these works, she focused on her favorite natural subjects—trees, sunflowers, weeds, and fields—and created the largest prints of her career, measuring as large as 51 by 79 inches. Sadly, Mitchell was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer while working on the series in 1992, making these works among the last the artist completed before passing away later that year.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/joanmitchelllithographs.png,"<p>Joan Mitchell, <i>Untitled (Fresh Air School)</i>, 1972.

As a Purist, Le Corbusier wanted to simplify the extravagant geometric abstractions of the Cubists, instead using organic, elemental shapes to create still lifes and portraits of women—both of which can be found in “Unité, Planche.” While some of the prints in “Unité, Planche” are black and white, many others feature technicolor backgrounds. After all, Le Corbusier once said, “Color is an immediate and spontaneous expression of life.”</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/lecorbusieruniteplanche.png,"<p>&copy; Le Corbusier / Artist Rights Society (ARS), New York, NY.</p>",4fab3cf6abf8bb000100087b,,,Planche,,

To create these hypnotic images, Quinn takes close-up photographs of his models’ eyes using a macro-lens—fashion legends Stella McCartney, Sarah Burton, and Karl Lagerfeld all posed for the series—and then paints these “mirrors of the souls” on circular canvases using an airbrush technique. Quinn later integrated images of world maps into his iris paintings and prints, inviting viewers to consider how the rise of globalism impacts the way they see the world.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/marcquinnirises.png,"<p>Marc Quinn, <i>Unique Mesosphere</i>, 2018.

It’s like having an ice pick shoved in your eyeball,” Close once <a href=""https://www.lensculture.com/articles/chuck-close-a-couple-ways-of-doing-something"">explained</a>.

Tom Wesselmann: Nudes,tom-wesselmann-nudes,Pop Art,"<p>“I don’t depict nudes from any sociological, cultural, or emotional intention,” <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/tom-wesselmann"">Tom Wesselmann</a> once <a href=""https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/robert-fulford-pop-artist-tom-wesselmanns-work-is-a-nude-awakening"">explained</a>. “The nude, I feel, is a good way to be aggressive, figuratively. I want to stir up intensive, explosive reactions in the viewers.” Wesselmann began painting nude women in 1959, rejecting the prevailing style of Abstract Expressionism in favor of graphic, provocative portraits. Perfectly fit for the sexual revolution of the 1960s, Wesselmann’s nudes often recline in suggestive poses, but with a comedic twist. His figures (many of whom are modeled after his wife, Claire Selley) boast exaggerated tan lines, drawing the viewer’s attention to their breasts and pubis. From his first series of nudes “Great American Nude” (1961–73) to his last “Sunset Nudes”(2003–04), Wesselmann experimented with new techniques (such as laser-cut steel drawings) and compositions (such as unconventional close-ups of the body) to discover new ways of tantalizing viewers with the female form. In 2008, Wesselmann’s playful rendition of art history’s classic odalisque figure, <i>Great American Nude No. 48</i> (1963), fetched $10.7 million at Sotheby’s, setting a record for the artist.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/tomwesselmannnude.png,"<p>Tom Wesselmann, <i>Sunset Nude, Yellow Tulips, Yellow Curtain</i>, 2003.

Roy Lichtenstein: Posters,roy-lichtenstein-posters,Artist Posters,"<p>Over the course of his career, <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/roy-lichtenstein"">Roy Lichtenstein</a> designed 70 posters to promote music and film festivals, political campaigns, nonprofit organizations, his own exhibitions, and more. Released in 1962, Lichtenstein’s first poster depicts a series of shaking hands, which celebrated his inaugural exhibition at the influential Leo Castelli Gallery. Since the posters were folded and sent by mail, these early exhibition advertisements (or “mailers”) are creased at the centerfold—a remnant from this bygone era of gallery advertising. By the mid-1960s, Lichtenstein’s cartoon aesthetic turned him into a household name, and the Pop artist began receiving commissions from institutions across the country—from New York’s Lincoln Center to Hollywood’s 20th Century Fox—to design their posters as well. In later decades, Lichtenstein would go on to leverage his worldwide fame to champion humanitarian causes and political campaigns. For example, his poster <i>Oval Office</i> (1992) was part of a fundraiser to support 10 female candidates running for the United States Senate.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/lichtenstein-posters.png,"<p>Roy Lichtenstein, <i>Crak!</i>, 1963.

His favorite animals to paint were cats, which the artist vivaciously portrayed through wide, multi-hued brushstrokes that transformed the pet into abstract forms. For Appel, painting these creatures was an instinctual and even animalistic act. “I never try to make a painting,” he <a href=""https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/238"">explained</a> in 1956. “It is a howl, it is naked, it is like a child, it is a caged tiger.” In 2012, Appel’s <i>Two Birds and a Flower</i> (1951) set the auction record for the artist, selling for over $950,000 at a Christie’s auction.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/karelappelanimals.png,"<p>&copy; Karel Appel / Artist Rights Society (ARS), New York, NY.</p>",,,,,,

Artist Skateboard Decks,artist-skateboard-decks,Collectible Sculptures,"<p>In the early 1970s, skate culture and street art became deeply intertwined, and a new medium for artists was born: the skate deck. In earlier days, when skateboarding was still a subculture on the fringe, simply being a skater was enough to set oneself apart from the crowd. However, the growing popularity of the sport pushed many creative skaters to find ways to individualize their boards. Borrowing from motifs and styles popularized by graffiti artists, skaters designed the undersides of their boards an extension of themselves. In the decades since, fine art, street art, and skate culture have become inseparable, with renowned artists like <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/keith-haring"">Keith Haring</a>, <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/shepard-fairey"">Shepard Fairey</a>, <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/yayoi-kusama"">Yayoi Kusama</a>, and <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/yoshitomo-nara"">Yoshitomo Nara</a> reproducing some of their most famous works on the decks of skateboards. </p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/skateboards.png,"<p>Keith Haring, <i>Set of 10</i>, 2012.

The rise of street art filled the city&rsquo;s subways with original graffiti, making art more accessible to the public. This mentality&mdash;that art should be for everyone&mdash;motivated Keith Haring in 1987 to open the Pop Shop, a storefront in Manhattan where the biggest artists of the day like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Kenny Scharf could sell sculptures, prints, and merchandise at affordable prices. Contemporary art stars like Jeff Koons, Takashi Murakami, and Maurizio Cattelan all follow in Haring&rsquo;s tradition, creating small sculptures of their most iconic motifs, perfectly sized for tabletops and shelves in any collector&rsquo;s home.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/pumpkinsbigartistsmallsculpture.png,"<p>Yayoi Kusama, <i>Kusama Pumpkins Set</i>, 2015.

Damien Hirst: Butterflies,damien-hirst-butterflies,Contemporary,"<p>For Damien Hirst, butterflies symbolize death and resurrection. The British artist debuted this motif when he was 26 years old, with his ambitious installation “In and Out of Love”(1991). To showcase the insects’ short lifespan, Hirst invited viewers to watch butterflies emerge from their cocoons, fly around the gallery space, and die before the show’s end. Decades after this career-defining exhibition, Hirst remains fascinated by butterflies. He’s arranged their wings into psychedelic patterns in his kaleidoscope paintings, turned them into stained glass windows in his cathedral prints, presented them neatly in rows for his entomology cabinets, and more. “You have to find universal triggers,” the artist <a href=""http://www.damienhirst.com/texts1/series/butterfly-colour-paintings"">explains</a>, “Everyone’s frightened of glass, everyone’s frightened of sharks, everyone loves butterflies.”</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/hirst-butterfly-1.png,"<p>Damien Hirst, <i>Your Beauty</i>, 2015.

To create his poppies, Sultan revived the dated tradition of Western still life painting and combined it with cutting-edge and intensive techniques using hot tar, spackle, and Masonite. Flowers, which often represent fragility and beauty, are realized in harsh industrial materials completely at odds with the subject matter. “The best art contains paradox, whether visual or narrative,” Donald Sultan once explained, and his poppies are a quintessential example of this artistic philosophy.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/donaldsultanpoppies.png,"<p>Donald Sultan, <i>12 Colors</i>, 2007.

Stationed a few miles outside of Paris, Kelly and his army buddies (one of whom even modeled for <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/pablo-picasso"">Pablo Picasso</a>) would travel into the city and immerse themselves in the art scene. After the war, Kelly was drawn back to Paris to study fine art, which led to his first solo exhibition of paintings at <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/galerie-maeght"">Galerie Maeght</a> in 1964. Galerie Maeght’s owners, who were avid lithographers, introduced Kelly to the printmaking technique. Later that year, Kelly began working on two strikingly different print series: his “Suite of Twenty-Seven Color Lithographs”(1964–65) showcases brightly-colored and slightly irregular shapes, while his “Suite of Plant Lithographs”(1964–66) features delicate line drawings of nature.

The series, which includes over 200 black-and-white photographs, is a testament to Sugimoto’s meditative and rigorous effort to capture the earth’s most basic elements. “Water and air. So very commonplace are these substances, they hardly attract attention—and yet they vouchsafe our very existence,” the artist once <a href=""https://www.sugimotohiroshi.com/seascapes-1/"">wrote</a>. “Every time I view the sea, I feel a calming sense of security, as if visiting my ancestral home.” To give the photographs a balanced quality, Sugimoto meticulously composes his seascapes to ensure each image presents sky and water in equal parts. Famous for his long exposure photography, Sugimoto also uses the analog technique to blur turbulent waves and passing clouds, giving his photographs a timeless aura. Sugimoto’s seascapes are among the artist’s most popular series, setting the auction record for the artist when the triptych <i>Black Sea, Ozuluce; Yellow Sea, Cheju; Red Sea, Safaga</i> (1991–1992) sold for nearly $1.9 million at Christie’s in 2007.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/hiroshisugimotoseascapes.png,"<p>Hiroshi Sugimoto, <i>Norwegian Sea, Vesteralen Island (335)</i>, 1990.

Joan Miró: Etchings,joan-miro-etchings,Modern,"<p>In 1938, the Surrealist <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/joan-miro"">Joan Miró</a> met the master printer Louis Marcoussis and quickly became enamored by etching, an intaglio technique of incising a design onto a metal plate. When travel pulled Miró away from Marcoussis’s studio, he sent him letters about his budding interests in the medium. “My dear friend,” he <a href=""https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_229_300087882.pdf"">wrote</a>, “I am in this beautiful country for a few days and am always thinking about this exciting technique of etching, which I will take up again as soon as I return, following your precious counsel.” Miró’s early etchings, produced during the turmoil of the Spanish Civil War, often explored a tension between darkness and color, incorporating different techniques such as aquatint and drypoint to heighten these contrasts. In 1967, Miró’s etching practice hit another breakthrough when he discovered that carborundum, an abrasive mineral, could give his prints even more depth and texture. These late carborundum prints are some of Miró’s most desirable etchings on the market, often selling in the high five-figure range at auction.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/joanmiroetching.png,"<p>&copy; Joan Miró / Artist Rights Society (ARS), New York, NY.</p>",4d8b927f4eb68a1b2c00017c,etching-slash-engraving,,,7500,TRUE

Indeed, Miró’s first prints were lithographs, a printmaking method that enables artists to draw directly on a stone slab or metal plate. Created in 1930, these early lithographs accompanied a book of poetry by Tristan Tzara and jumpstarted Miró’s lifelong love of the lithography technique. From from 1954 to 1958, Miró nearly gave up painting altogether to focus on these prints, earning him the Grand Prize for Graphic Work at the Venice Biennale in 1954. Some of Miró’s lithographs, such as his collaborations with the fine art publisher <i>Derrière le Miroir</i>, recreate his paintings on paper, while many others, such as his 1944 “Barcelona” series, are entirely new designs that explore the possibilities of the lithography technique.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/joan-miro-lithograph.png,"<p>&copy; Joan Miró / Artist Rights Society (ARS), New York, NY.</p>",4d8b927f4eb68a1b2c00017c,lithograph-1,,,1000,TRUE

Notably, Albers chose to arrange the prints out of chronological order, favoring a lineup that focused on color relationships. The portfolio, released in an edition of 1,000, is in the permanent collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, SFMOMA, the British Museum, and the Stedelijk Museum, among other institutions.

The artist, an early student (and later, a professor) of the Bauhaus, the legendary German art and design school, was fascinated by the ability to create the illusion of three-dimensions using only color and spatial relationships. Albers had a long career as a professor at Black Mountain College before joining Yale University’s Art Department, where he began his iconic abstract series at age 62. Over the coming decades, Albers would make more than 1,000 oil paint and silkscreen “Homages” before his death at age 88 in 1976. The works feature nested squares in different shades, which Albers often applied directly from the paint tube onto fiberboard.

KAWS soon devised a strategy: break into the booths, remove their advertising posters, add his own graffiti to the posters, and then reinstall them back in the booth another night. “When I started painting on advertisements, it occurred to me that the ad really set the work in a specific time,” KAWS <a href=""https://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/kaws"">once said</a>. Indeed, his takes on Calvin Klein advertisements, featuring a young Kate Moss and Christy Turlington, capture the cultural moment of the late 1990s.

Over the next eight years, Haring created over 80 unique posters, from corporate advertisements for Absolut and Lucky Strike to cultural announcements for the Montreux Jazz Festival and the World Breakdance Championship. Haring also used posters as a means for social activism, spreading awareness about the crack cocaine epidemic in the United States, apartheid in South Africa, global nuclear disarmament, and the devastation of AIDS—a disease Haring would eventually face.

Pablo Picasso: Lithographs,pablo-picasso-lithographs,Modern,"<p><a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/pablo-picasso"">Pablo Picasso</a> was a prolific printmaker, producing over 2,400 original prints throughout his career in a variety of techniques. But until 1945, almost all of his prints were black and white, and only a handful of them were lithographs, a printmaking method that closely resembles painting, enabling artists to draw directly on a stone slab or metal plate. This ratio drastically changed when Picasso met the master printmaker <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/fernand-mourlot"">Fernand Mourlot</a>. In just under two decades, Picasso and Mourlot produced over 350 lithographs (many of them in color), experimenting with unconventional techniques like finger painting that pushed the boundaries of the medium.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/pablopicassolithograph.png,"<p>&copy; Pablo Picasso / Artist Rights Society (ARS), New York, NY.</p>",4d8b928b4eb68a1b2c0001f2,lithograph-1,,,2000,TRUE
Pablo Picasso: Portraits,pablo-picasso-portraits,Modern,"<p>Although <a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artist/pablo-picasso"">Pablo Picasso</a> worked in a variety of different styles and mediums throughout his prolific career, he never stopped creating portraits of those in his inner circle. Even in his most abstract portraits, Picasso captures his sitters’ personalities. For example, his cubist portrait of his friend and art dealer <i><a href=""https://www.artsy.net/artwork/pablo-picasso-portrait-of-art-dealer-ambroise-vollard-1867-1939"">Ambroise Vollard</a></i> (1910), shows the figure broken down into geometric, angled shapes, although the viewer can still discover that Vollard was a serious and somewhat gruff individual with his downcast eyes and frown. Picasso is also famous for his portraits of his lovers, which often distort their features into playful abstractions. His sultry sleeping portrait of Marie-Thérèse Walter, <i>Le Rêve</i> (1932) is among the world’s most expensive paintings ever sold, reaching $155 million through a private sale in 2013. Regarding his outlook on portraiture, Picasso was often elusive. “When you start with a portrait and search for a pure form, a clear volume, through successive eliminations, you arrive inevitably at the egg,” he once said, “Likewise, starting with the egg and following the same process in reverse, one finishes with the portrait.”</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/picassoportrait1.png,"<p>&copy; Pablo Picasso / Artist Rights Society (ARS), New York, NY.</p>",4d8b928b4eb68a1b2c0001f2,portrait,,,2000,TRUE

Indiana believed that each number has its own personality and symbolism, with one representing birth and zero representing death, and the numbers in between symbolizing periods from childhood through adulthood. He also attached significance to the colors he chose for his numbers, favoring red for one and four to convey the vibrancy of birth and the fiery period of adolescence, and grey for zero to convey a waning sense of time at the close of one’s life. For Indiana, many of these numbers also held personal connections, such as the highway routes and building numbers that were important to him.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/robertindiananumbers.png,"<p>&copy; Robert Indiana / Artist Rights Society (ARS), New York, NY.</p>",4d8b92784eb68a1b2c00013e,,,Number,3000,TRUE

After dedicating several works to one another, Motherwell and Paz finally collaborated to produce <i>Three Poems</i> (1987–88), a suite of 27 lithographs accompanied by Paz’s poetry translated into English, initially inspired by the duo’s vacation in Mexico in 1967. After a small initial run in 1981–82, the complete set was revived by the New York print shop, the Limited Editions Club, in an edition of 750 in 1987–88.

Printmaking was the perfect medium for the artist, who was fascinated with incorporating everyday materials into his art, including family photographs, street litter, magazine cut-outs, receipts, his personal medical x-rays, and even astrological charts. To create his ambitious collage-like prints, Rauschenberg invented entirely new printmaking techniques, such as one that combined lithography with silkscreen, in collaboration with the master printmaker Kenneth Tyler. Rauschenberg credits his success as a printmaker with his dyslexia. “I already see things backwards!” he says. “You see, in printmaking everything comes out backwards so printing is an absolute natural for me.”</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/robertrauschenberglithographs.png,"<p>Robert Rauschenberg, <i>Front Roll</i>, 1964.

Over the next 35 years, the artist created over 100 posters celebrating iconic historical moments, including the first landing on the moon and the first Earth Day, in his signature collage aesthetic.</p>",http://files.artsy.net/images/rauschenbergposter.png,"<p>Robert Rauschenberg, <i>St Louis Symphony Orchestra</i>, 1968.

Of these projects, the book most closely linked to Dalí’s own cultural heritage is Miguel de Cervantes’s <i>Don Quixote De La Mancha</i>, widely regarded as the most influential novel of the Spanish Golden Age. Dalí illustrated a 1946 edition of the novel, which he filled with 38 unique drawings of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza’s horseback adventures across Spain. Nearly two decades later, when Dalí received a commission to create a suite of prints inspired by the icons of Spanish culture, he turned again to this classic tale.

Dalí also created a series of illustrations for the cookbook that depict his indulgent treats, but with a surrealist twist.
